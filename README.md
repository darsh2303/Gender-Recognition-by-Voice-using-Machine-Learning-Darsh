## Gender Recognition by Voice using Machine Learning
Classification of Gender using pitch analysis mainly aims to predict the speakerâ€™s gender by analyzing the voice sample  containing different parameters.


### Data Description
 - This database was created to identify a Human voice as male or female, based upon acoustic properties of the voice and speech. The dataset consists of 3,168 recorded voice samples, collected from male and female speakers.

- Acoustic properties are - meanfreqmean, sd(Standard Deviation in Freq), median, Q25, Q75 ,IQR, skew, kurt, spectral entropy, sfm(spectral flatness), mode, centroid, meanfun, minfun, maxfun, meandom, mindom, maxdom, dfrange, modindx and label indicates the Category Male or Female.
 
 - We  have attempted to classify gender using ten trained models among them the SVM model performs better than the others.

- The Model which we proposed has best accuracy and performance.

- Models with good performance will help to use and develop voice based gender recognition systems more effectively in wide range of aspects.
